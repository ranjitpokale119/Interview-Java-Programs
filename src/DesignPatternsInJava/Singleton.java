/*
* Implementation of Singleton Class
There are several ways to implement or design a Singleton class. The following are some popular methods by which we can design a Singleton class:

1. Eager Initialization Method
2. Lazy Initialization Method
3. Thread Safe Singleton Method
4. Lazy Initialization with Double Lock Method
5. Lazy Load Method
6. Static Block Initialization Method
7. Bill Pugh Implementation Method
